# Development Log

This is the dev log for globalchina theme. It is sorted in chronological order where each entry of log corresponds to a level 3 header.

### 2023/03/12 Megamenu

#### reference:
[basic layout](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_mega_menu.asp)
[full functionality](https://codepen.io/mohnaji94/pen/evbWGW)

A primary megamenu is added manually to `partials/navigation.hbs` (this file will overwrite the default navigation helper)

It works, but the style need more furnishing.

Might consider to manually write the megamenus since it's hard to make it a page

Or maybe I can create an unpublished page for each tab with megamenu
