[v] make megamenu dropdown in hamburger menu (zindex front all nav items)

[v] make megamenu dropdown in normal size a little less wider 

[v] make megamenu dropdown resize according to its content (bootstrap grid)

[x] make navbar shrink to hamburger on flex, so that there won't be 
    a two-row navbar
    
    > ALT: adjust media query max-width and navbar width, so that it will 
            shrink before wrapping (pixel-level control)

[v] make navbar font clearer

[ ] make megamenu click instead of hover in hamburger menu (mobile friendly)

    On click, fill the screen with the megamenu page, so that I don't need to 
    write a new megamenu dropdown 

    Or I could just write another dropdown, and show it only when in hamburger menu
    i.e. max-width=800px

[ ] Make font-size in megamenu responsive

[ ] make megamenu dropdown animation
